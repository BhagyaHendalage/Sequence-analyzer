# Sequence-analyzer
The Python program includes classes and methods to analyze biological sequences (DNA, RNA and amino acid)
More specifically, it includes the following methods

- Method to return the sequence type

- Methods to calculate nucleotide base counts in DNA and RNA sequences. The
same methods should be able to plot a graph to compare each base count and
save it in a figure

- Methods to calculate AT content in DNA and RNA sequences

- Methods to calculate GC content in DNA and RNA sequences
A method to compare AT and GC contents of two given input nucleotide
sequences using a suitable graph
A method to transcribe an DNA sequence
A method to generate all possible combinations of 3-mers and 4-mers given
the constituent bases
